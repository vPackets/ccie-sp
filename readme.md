## üåü Career Objective

Achieve the **CCIE Service Provider certification (v5.1)** by **February 2026** and be ready to take on senior-level Service Provider architecture and design responsibilities by mid-2026.

This includes:
- Mastering the full CCIE SP blueprint with deep hands-on experience and automation skills.
- Demonstrating the ability to plan, design, implement, operate, and optimize dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) SP networks.
- Becoming proficient in MPLS, Segment Routing, QoS, multicast VPN, network slicing, and cloud-native BNGs.
- Leading initiatives in SP automation using NSO, model-driven telemetry, Ansible, and Python.
- Being capable of driving network modernization through secure, scalable architectures (RON, SRv6, and disaggregated infrastructure).
- Preparing to contribute to strategic SP transformation projects within an organization or as a consultant.

By achieving this, I aim to position myself as a trusted technical leader in the Service Provider domain, capable of influencing roadmap decisions and mentoring others in advanced SP technologies.
